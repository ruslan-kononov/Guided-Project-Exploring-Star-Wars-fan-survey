# Guided Project:Exploring Star Wars fan survey
While waiting for Star Wars: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Force_Awakens">The Force Awakens</a> to come out in 2015, the team at <a href="">FiveThirtyEight</a> became interested in answering some questions about Star Wars fans. In particular, they wondered: is “The Empire Strikes Back” truly considered the best episode of the franchise?

The team needed to collect data addressing this question. To do this, they surveyed Star Wars fans using the online tool SurveyMonkey. They received 835 total responses, which are available on their <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey">GitHub repository</a>.

For this project, we will be cleaning and exploring the data set in Jupyter notebook. We will also answer the following questions:
- Is “The Empire Strikes Back” the best episode of the franchise?
- Are there any differences in rankings and the size of the audience across genders?
- How does an average fan of the Star Wars series look like (in terms of his/her gender, age, education level and household income)?
